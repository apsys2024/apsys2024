# Call for Posters

[[plaintext version](cfposters.txt)]

APSys 2024 calls for posters to present innovative research in various fields of computer systems.
The posters will be presented during the workshop’s poster session, aiming to highlight new or ongoing research and provide an opportunity for authors to interact directly with workshop participants.

We highly encourage you to submit controversial works, crazy ideas, and thought-provoking, innovative perspectives in designing and implementing novel computer systems.

If the number of submissions is high, some posters may be selected for a few minutes of lightning talks instead. If you would like to conduct a demo alongside your poster, please contact us in advance to discuss the arrangements.

## Submission Instructions

Submissions must include an extended abstract no longer than one 8.5×11inch page, including all figures and references, formatted in [standard ACM two-column conference style](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) with 10-pt font size.
Your abstract should contain a brief description of the problem, the key contributions of your work, how your work compares to prior research, and any results from your evaluation.

Please note that the posters, demos, and extended abstracts will not be included in the workshop proceedings, but the abstracts will be available on this website.

The submission site is as follows.
