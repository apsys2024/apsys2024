## How to Get There
### From Kansai International airport (KIX)
Use [Kansai-Airport Express “HARUKA”](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/travel/shopping/access/train.html) to Kyoto station, and then follow the instruction for "From Kyoto Station".

Pro-tip:
- Queueing in the line to buy express tickets at the airport station might take some time.
- If you have a transportation IC-card (Suica, ICOCA, PASMO, etc., either physical or mobile), simply enter the gate using the IC-card and buy an express ticket **inside the train**. Just take a non-reserved seat and ask a in-train staff after the train leaves the station.
- Note that this is a completely legitimate way and you still pay the exact same price as you would when buying a ticket ouside the gate.

### From Osaka-Itami airport
Use a limousine bus to Kyoto station, and then follow the instruction for "From Kyoto Station".
The bus line is operated by Hankyu-Kanko and leaves the airport every 15 - 20 mins. No reservation is needed.

### From Tokyo
From central Tokyo, taking Shinkansen (bullet train) from Tokyo station to Kyoto station is the best option.
If you plan to directly fly from Tokyo to either Kansai-Internatinal or Osaka-Itami, follow the instructions above.

### From Kyoto station
We highly recommend to use the subway to get to the venue from Kyoto station.
Here are the concrete steps for you to follow.
1. Take a subway Karasuma line (JP: 烏丸線) train bound for Kokusaikaikan (Kyoto International Conference Center). Don't worry, there is only a single subway line accessible from Kyoto station, and every train in the correct direction goes to the same destination.
2. Get off the train at Karasuma Oike (JP: 烏丸御池) station.
3. Change trains to a subway Tozai line (JP: 東西線) train bound for Rokujizo. Don't worry again, there is only a single subway line possible to change for you at this station, and every train in the correct direction brings you to our destination.
4. Get off the train at Kyoto Shiyakusyo-mae (JP: 京都市役所前) station. The venue is directly connected from Exit 3. Go up the escalator to reach the lobby.
