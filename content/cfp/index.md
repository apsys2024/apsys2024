The 15th SIGOPS Asia-Pacific Workshop on Systems will be held in Kyoto, Japan on September 4-5, 2024. Building on the success of its predecessors, APSys 2024 will continue to be a lively forum for systems researchers and practitioners across the world to meet, interact, and collaborate with their peers from the Asia/Pacific region. APSys takes a broad view of systems, including but no limited to:

- Operating systems
- Virtualization
- File and storage systems
- Networked systems
- Mobile, embedded, and IoT systems
- Cloud computing and data centers
- Edge computing
- Big data systems
- Distributed systems
- Green and sustainable computing
- Debugging, testing, verification
- Measurement, monitoring, and modeling
- Reliability, scalability, and fault tolerance
- Security and privacy
- Systems for machine learning, machine learning for systems
- Hardware and software interaction
- Experience with deployed systems
- Blockchain and cryptocurrency systems

## Submissions

Submissions should be five or fewer pages in length excluding references, formatted in standard ACM two-column conference style with 10-pt font size. Authors should consult the [ACM website](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) for the up to date template. Reviewing will be double-blind: no author or affiliation information should appear in the submission. The authors should additionally follow the best practice in order not to disclose their identities implicitly. A submission may present preliminary results, propose a new research direction, provide insightful retrospective, or offer a provocative viewpoint on an important systems topic. Papers will be selected based on their likelihood of generating insightful technical discussions at the workshop and influencing future systems research. Relevant attributes include originality, technical merit, clarity, and technical relevance. Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the workshop, which will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Consistent with standard scholarly practice, the authors should not have substantially similar work in review anywhere else.

Submissions can be made online at https://apsys24.hotcrp.com.

## Policy

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors [obtain an ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/register), so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a [commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs). We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

Authors should also consult [ACM Publications Policies](https://www.acm.org/publication
s/policies), especially those around Authors; Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification; Research Involving Human Subjects; Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions; and Coercion and Abuse; **and the [use of Generative AI in papers](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questions)**.


## Camera-ready Instructions

Below are the general formatting rules for the final papers of APSys 2024:

- The final paper, including all text, figures, tables, and any appendices, must fit within the SIX-page limit. References have no page limit.
- ACM is the publisher for APSys 2024. Please format your final version in standard ACM two-column conference style with 10-pt font size.
- Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page.
- Graphs and figures should be readable without magnification.
- Since ACM cannot substitute font types, the fonts of the final papers must be scalable Type 1 fonts, not bit-mapped Type 3. Otherwise, the formatting paper may be rejected during the ACM production procedure.
- All fonts must be embedded. To help you through this process, you can refer to the [embedded font checking guidelines](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/word-to-pdf-instructions-.txt) from ACM.

To help you with formatting your final papers, we recommend using the [latex template](https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/latex_templates/acmart-primary.zip
) of [ACM Proceedings Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

- Please use the standard 'sigconf' proceedings option in '\documentclass'.
- Authors should apply ACM Computing Classification categories and terms.
- ACM has deprecated all older style files and released a new template that supersedes prior templates. Authors should not use the older deprecated versions.
- Authors will receive an email to submit a copyright form formally to ACM. Once ACM approves the submitted form, authors will receive a response that will have the DOI number, ISBN number, and additional information regarding the paper. Authors need to use this information to update the corresponding fields in the latex template, which will be visible at the left bottom of the first page. As rights management emails from rightsreview@acm.org are sent by an automated system, please check your SPAM folders if they do not appear in your inbox.

Please note that the camera-ready paper must be submitted to the [submission website](https://apsys24.hotcrp.com) by July 30, 2024. For any additional questions, please send an email to the APSys 2024 publication chair: Atsushi Koshiba (apsys2024-publication@googlegroups.com).
