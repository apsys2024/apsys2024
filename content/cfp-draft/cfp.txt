* Overview

The 15th ACM SIGOPS Asia-Pacific Workshop on Systems (APSys 2024) will
be held in Kyoto, Japan on September 4-5, 2024. Building on the
success of its predecessors, APSys 2024 will continue to be a lively
forum for systems researchers and practitioners across the world to
meet, interact, and collaborate with their peers from the Asia/Pacific
region. APSys takes a broad view of systems, including but no limited
to:

- Operating systems
- Virtualization
- File and storage systems
- Networked systems
- Mobile, embedded, and IoT systems
- Cloud computing and data centers
- Edge computing
- Big data systems
- Distributed systems
- Green and sustainable computing
- Debugging, testing, verification
- Measurement, monitoring, and modeling
- Reliability, scalability, and fault tolerance
- Security and privacy
- Systems for machine learning, machine learning for systems
- Hardware and software interaction
- Experience with deployed systems
- Blockchain and cryptocurrency systems

* Submission Guidelines

Submissions should be **five** or fewer pages in length excluding
references, formatted in standard ACM two-column conference style with
10-pt font size. Reviewing will be **double-blind**: no author or
affiliation information should appear in the submission. The authors
should additionally follow the best practice in order not to disclose
their identities implicitly. A submission may present preliminary
results, propose a new research direction, provide insightful
retrospective, or offer a provocative viewpoint on an important
systems topic. Papers will be selected based on their likelihood of
generating insightful technical discussions at the workshop and
influencing future systems research. Relevant attributes include
originality, technical merit, clarity, and technical
relevance. Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the
workshop, which will be published in the ACM Digital
Library. Consistent with standard scholarly practice, the authors
should not have substantially similar work in review anywhere else.
