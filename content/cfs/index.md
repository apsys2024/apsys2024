# Call for Sponsors

APSys is the Asia’s premier workshop for computer systems software technology, representing activities in both academia and industry. It attracts the leading researchers and luminaries in the field and features the best and brightest of the Ph.D. candidates in computer systems.

APSys’24 will be held offline on September 4-5, 2024, Kyoto, Japan. Industrial support has always been instrumental in making computer systems research a success. We, the organizing committee, are writing to ask your organization to kindly consider being a sponsor for APSys’24.

A number of sponsorship levels are available, as listed further below. Sponsorship allows us to provide stipends (up to USD 1,000) for students to help cover their travel, lodging, meals, and workshop registration. These students are made well aware of the sources of their stipends. Sponsorship also supports events such as lunch meals and receptions, during which important connections are established and the research directions at industry labs and academic institutions are explored by the delegates. The workshop attendees will be made well aware of the financial sponsors of events.

You can find more information in our [sponsorship brochure](cfsponsor.pdf).
