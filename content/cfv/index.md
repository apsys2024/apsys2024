# Call for Student Volunteers

APSys 2024 calls for student volunteers who can help us operate the workshop.
The merits of being a student volunteer includes, but not limited to:
- Building live connection with world-class researchers in the systems field
- Making friends / discussing on systems topic with fellow students from all over the world
- Exploring around Kyoto and nearby area, if time permits :)

We would like to ask the student volunteers some operational work, for example
- Logistics: setting up the conference room, locating the poster panels, etc.
- Reception: checking people in and handling the badges, etc.
- Other tasks: circulating microphones, timekeeping, etc.

Any inquery about student volunteers must be sent to the LA chair (Soramichi Akiyama).
